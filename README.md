Hack client by TheTetrisDude (partially based on tutorials by srgantmoomoo and stupitdog,) made for fun (and also to improve my modding/coding skills)

# Installation
Download mod from releases, put it in your MC mods folder or use gradlew build to build from source. It's for 1.12.2 forge btw
# Keybindings
- Sprint : CapsLock 

- Velocity : V 

- Crits : C 

# Future plans!
Here are my ideas to implement in the future:

- add configs in the form of json files so you can swap configs easily or save them

- add commands to the mod (prefix ~ in chat)

- add more hacks, replace copy/pasted components of the client with my fully original code
